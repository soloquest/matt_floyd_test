===============

This is a test repository between Floyd and Matt

So now I have cloned the file into the local computer after figuring out how to "disconnect" Matt's repositories and logging him outfrom this machine, because prior to that, every time I tried to clone my test repository from github to this mac, it would open Matt's repositories and I couldn't find mine. Got it gigured out now. Onward.

Now I have created a branch in git called "Floyd Branch #1",and now I have to publish it ad figure out how to get it to Matt.

April 12 - I'm editing this readme file because it seems that the only way I can publish something is if I make a change to it. Makes sense, so I'm adding this. I just sent Matt an http link to the repository to see if we can collaborate. I have an SSH key to access the repository, but I beleive the http method is easier right now. Waiting to hear from Matt to see if this is working, then we can start pushing code.
